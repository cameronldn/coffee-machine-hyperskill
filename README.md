This is the *Coffee Machine* made in Javascript during the Hyperskill course.


<p>The project simulates a coffee machine, tracking inventory and money obtained.</p>
<p>The user has the option to buy one of several coffees, fill the inventory, take the money, or check inventory.
If a task cannot be complete, relevant feedback is provided to the user. Contains basic input validation to ensure the user is guided to inputting information correctly.</p>
